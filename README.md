## Virtual A.I Assitant (Neural Networks)

 # Overview
Welcome to the Virtual AI Assistant (JARVIS) Project! This System is designed to create a versatile AI assistant capable of performing a wide range of tasks to assist users in various domains, such as information retrieval, scheduling, and more. The AI assistant leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to understand and respond to user inputs effectively. Additionally, JARVIS can also control home automation devices, such as turning lights and switches on and off.

# Features
-> Natural Language Understanding: The AI assistant can comprehend and respond to user queries in natural language.

-> Task Management: Create, update, and manage tasks and to-do lists.

-> Scheduling: Set reminders, schedule appointments, and manage your calendar.

-> Information Retrieval: Fetch information from the web, databases, and other sources.

-> Home Automation: Control smart home devices, such as turning lights and switches on and off.

-> Integration: Integrate with various third-party services and APIs.

-> Neural Networks: Utilize neural networks for advanced natural language processing and understanding.
